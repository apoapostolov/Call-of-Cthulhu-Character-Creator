      theme: "Modern-day Lovecraftian horror, urban decay",
      setting: "a decaying urban apartment, a forgotten corner of a university library, or a rain-slicked city street at night",
      atmosphere: "tense, isolated, and unnerving. A sense of ordinary life being peeled back to reveal something sanity-shattering underneath.",
      visualStyle: "Hyper-realistic, gritty digital painting with a cinematic feel. Use a muted, realistic color palette but with high contrast and dramatic, naturalistic lighting (e.g., the glow of a smartphone screen, harsh streetlights, the flicker of a faulty neon sign).",
      additionalDetails: "Characters should look like ordinary people (students, baristas, office workers, police officers) who have been thrust into extraordinary circumstances. Show signs of sleep deprivation, anxiety, and the dawning horror of their situation. Their clothing should be contemporary and mundane.",
