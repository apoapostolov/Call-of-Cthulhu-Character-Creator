            artStyle: "Resembles early 2000s action thrillers like the Bourne series; slightly desaturated, gritty, with a high-contrast digital look. Handheld camera feel.",
            fashion: "Post-9/11 practicality. Boot-cut jeans, polo shirts, cargo pants. Early decade had more nu-metal/skater influences. Bulky tactical gear for professionals.",
            looks: "For men, spiky hair, goatees. For women, straightened hair with layers, thinner eyebrows. A more casual, less polished look than later decades.",
            mannerisms: "Less phone-centric. A more direct, less ironic communication style. A sense of heightened alert and seriousness in professional settings.",
            politicsAndMood: "Defined by the September 11th attacks and the subsequent War on Terror. A mood of heightened security, patriotism, fear, and a burgeoning surveillance state.",
            technology: "Chunky flip phones and candy bar phones (Nokia). Bulky CRT monitors and early LCD screens. Dial-up and early broadband internet. The iPod."
