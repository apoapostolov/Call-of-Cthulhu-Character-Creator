      theme: "Victorian Gothic horror, gaslit mystery",

      atmosphere: "oppressive, mysterious, and decadent. A sense of societal decay and hidden horrors beneath a veneer of progress.",
      visualStyle: "emulate the look of early daguerreotype or silver plate photography. Use a high-contrast, almost black-and-white palette, with deep shadows and the warm, isolated glow of gas lamps.",
      additionalDetails: "Characters are gentlemen investigators, curious journalists, or members of secret societies. They should be dressed in formal Victorian attire (top hats, corsets, frock coats) that appears slightly disheveled or worn by their grim pursuits.",
