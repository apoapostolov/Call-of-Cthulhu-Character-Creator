      theme: "1920s Lovecraftian horror, Prohibition-era mystery",
      setting: "a dusty antiquarian's library, a smoke-filled speakeasy, or the fog-shrouded docks of Arkham",
      atmosphere: "foreboding, grim, and academic. A sense of creeping dread and the weight of forbidden knowledge.",
      visualStyle: "emulate the look of early 20th-century autochrome or black and white photography, with a touch of gritty realism. Use a sepia or desaturated color palette with high contrast and dramatic, moody lighting (e.g., harsh lamplight, long shadows).",
      additionalDetails: "Characters should appear as plausible individuals from the 1920s (professors, detectives, dilettantes) who are subtly marked by their encounters with the uncanny—showing signs of stress, lack of sleep, or a haunted, thousand-yard stare. Their clothing and gear should be period-appropriate.",
